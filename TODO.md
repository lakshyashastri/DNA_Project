- RESET DB Option (only if Lester?)

- Adversary_wield close_assc_wield merge
- View for derived attribute of close associate: basically create a view and display that instead of table whenever required
- Show address as well with data for tables with address_id? (either that full address in a separate table or joined in the same table?)
- **DISPLAY ALL (OR SPECIFIC) TABLES**
- choice handle simple space input
